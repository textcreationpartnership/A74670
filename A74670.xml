            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

afflict me very much, and for the third I am ſore grieved.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry that ever I yielded to any provocation, and

was it not of ſo much concernment to me to recompence as to ſuffer wrong.
This fault I might extenuate to a very ſmall guilt, having taken the old
Protestation to preſerve and defend the liberty of the Subject, and ſeek
the Reformation of the Church, which have been ſo much violated and
obſtructed by worldly-intereſted men. For the future I truſt ſo to
demean my ſelfe as one committing his way to the Lord in patience and
wel-doing, bearing the Croſſe daily and ſinking down into the Death by
chearfull obedience and ſelfe-denyall, whereby I may fill up the ſufferings
of Christ that are behinde in my mortall body.</p>

improve it with more wiſdome: and if ever the Lord ſhine and ſend into

of God upon my endeavours, I have found out in the practice of Phyſick)
prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the publick good before my own private advantage, being moved
alſo by Charity, Chriſtian compaſſion, and the neceſſity of ſick
people, according to my truſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <pb n="4" facs="tcp:120015:14"/>and
practice of Phyſick, I would firſt take my eyes in my hand, as I may ſo
ſay, and by the help of <hi>Vulcan</hi> ſearch and diligently examine the
chief and choyceſt things, before I would commend them to publick uſe and
profit, that ſo the Children of knowledge, thoſe ſearchers out and lovers
of Truth may attain that at a cheap rate which hath coſt me dear the
learning, <hi>viz.</hi> not fallacious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions (as hitherto in ſuch a deale
of Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain they have complained of) but the truth it ſelf ſo long
deſired, by many experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments moſt certainly found out and known. So that
many things after the revolution of the Platonick year have been returned
gratis, and with uſury to their owners, whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and far more
compleat, which before I had from them ragged and torn at a great rate. For
many, whoſe rumor of many hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſecrets inticed me unto them with much
difficulty of travel, and no ſmall expence, their very preſence or ſight
of them much abated of their report, as it often falls out in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
ſo that thoſe things which they bragged of as great ſecrets, ſeemed to
me either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or ſo faulty and defective, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of
their many deſcriptions, was to be made up by me, being all reduced into one
onely, and that ſame firſt proved by my own Chymicall triall. Alſo by
exchange to their advantage (according to that common Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall cuſtome,
<hi>Give ſomething, and take ſomething</hi>) comparing my ſtudies many
times <pb n="5" facs="tcp:120015:14"/>with theirs, in our Conference they got an Egg for a
Nut, which when I had crackt with long and fruitleſſe paines, I found at
laſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a worm-eaten kernel, or inſtead of a kernel I got only
husks and ſhells.</p>
                  <p>Hence it comes to paſſe, that without Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
<hi>Vulcan,</hi> which the Poets commend as the moſt true Inventer and
Teacher of Arts Myſteries, the greateſt part of them (without offence to
thoſe great men be it ſpoken) who have written in our time of the more
ſecret Spagyrical preparations from other mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation &amp; not their own

<hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> that for the moſt part after great coſt beſtowed in
vain, they have in the end aſcribed to them the cauſe of their loſt
labour, and long ſpent time.</p>
                  <p>That it is ſo, they will eaſily acknowledge with me, who not
content with my example and others loſſe, had rather be made more wary by
their own experience, and examine the like things again by the help of

operations which are aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every one in order, according to which I
eſteem the Medicine, as I have ſet down and ſhewed their preparations in

know how to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true and falſe, who are well grown and
exerciſed in <hi>Chymicall</hi> employments, I mean the Sons of Art, who know

true <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> who can even by a glance and ſight only make a
good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and eaſily gueſſe of theſe things (for theſe

                  <p>Therefore the true and more profound Phiſitians, who have been

depend upon the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. This Phyſicall eſſence
in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is called Gold. Phyſick is written in the book of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (1)

                     <p>Now this Medicine, as naturall Mummy and kernell of Nature, is

foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Balſam of Vegetables, Mineralls and Animalls, from which
every action in Nature hath its beginning: By its onely power all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes

ſeparated from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, and in a due order conveniently admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred

                     <p>The Foundation of this Phyſick is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the
agreement of the leſſer World Man with the greater and externall world, as
we are ſufficiently inſtructed by Aſtronomy and Philoſophy, which
explaine thoſe two Globes, <pb n="24" facs="tcp:120015:24"/>the ſuperiour and inferiour.
Philoſophy teath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the force and properties of Earth and Wate,-as
Aſtronomy doth of the Firmament and Aire. Phyloſophy and Aſtronomy make
up an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and perfect Phyloſopher, not onely in the great World, but
alſo in the leſſer: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary to accommodate the
diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the great World as of a parent to the little World as to
the Son, and duly compare the Anotomy of the World with the Anotomy of Man.</p>
                     <p>The outward World is a ſpeculative Anoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, wherein we may
ſee, as in a glaſſe, the leſſer World Man; for ſo much of his
wonderfull and excellent fabrick and creation as is neceſſary for a
Phyſitian to know, cannot be underſtood from the man himſelfe: For they
agree not in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form or corporall ſubſtance,<note place="margin">What

Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or the great world no Phyſitian can have an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Man.</note> the outward form at leaſt differenceth the
World and Man. This is moſt evident from the Light of Nature, which is
nothing elſe but a divine Analogy of this viſible world with the body of
man; For whatſoever lyeth hid and unſeen in Man, is made manifeſt in the
viſible Anotomy of the whole Univerſe, for the Microcoſmicall Nature in
Man is inviſible and incomprehenſible:<note place="margin">The great World is
a ſpeculation and glaſſe of the little World Man.</note> Therefore in the
viſible and comprehenſible Anotomy of the great World, all things are
manifeſt as in their Parent: Heaven and Earth are Man's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, out of
which Man laſt of all was created; <pb n="25" facs="tcp:120015:24"/>He that knowes the
parents,<note place="margin">Man is the End of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and
Aſtronomy.</note> and can Anotomize them, hath attained the true knowledge of
their child Man, the moſt perfect creature in all his properties; becauſe
all things of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe meet in him as in the Centre, and the
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notomy of him in his Nature is the Anotomy of the whole world.</p>
                     <p>The externall world is the figure of Man, and Man is an hidden
world, becauſe viſible things in him are inviſible, and when they are
made viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then they are diſeaſes, not health, as truly as he is the
little world and not the great one: And this is the true knowledge, that Man
may Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſmically be known viſibly and inviſibly or magically. The
knowledge of every ſound and perfect Phyſitian proceedeth from the true and
full Anotomy both of the great and little world, unto which he may ſafely
truſt as to a moſt ſure Anchor. Conſidering then the originall of all
diſeaſes, it will appear that the Nature, as well of the Macrocoſme as
the Microcoſme, is its own medicine, diſeaſe, and Phyſitian; A
Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian muſt ſpring out of Nature; for in him, and of him, and from
him is nothing but all of Nature onely; Nature, not man, maketh a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian.
And becauſe the Matter of Man is the Extract of the four Elements, it is
requiſite that he have in himſelfe a familiarity with all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and
their fruits, inaſmuch as without them he cannot live. For what man can be
without Aire, Earth, Water or Fire, or their effects? God created the Elements
for their fruits ſake, that they might ſuſtaine and preſerve Man with 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120015:25"/>food and Phyſick.<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the
4 Elements doe ſhew every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe in man and its cure.</note> Therefore
all the externall Elements repreſent unto us the whole Man, which being
known, Man alſo is underſtood, for they are alike, and are the very
Microcoſm; and in the foure Elements there is but one Anatomy eſſence and
matter, all the differenc being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Form;<note place="margin">The
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in the outward world is to be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the

is Fire, Aire, Earthy Water. Againe there is Water, Caeleſtiall Earth.
Likewiſe Terrene, Fiery, Airy Water. Laſtly Airy Fre, Airy Water, Airy
Earth. There are alſo four kinds of Mercury, and four ſorts of Mettalls, a

inviſible works then in his viſible.</p>

Inhabitants of the Elements, who differ from Men created after the Image of
God, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, wiſdome, arts, operations, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                     <p>To the Water there belong Nimphs, Undens, Meloſyns, whoſe

                     <p>To the Earth doe belong Gnoms, Lemurs, Sylphs, Montans,

                     <p>Thus alſo there is a fourfold Medicine; For example, the
fiery, airy, watry, earthy <hi>Heart</hi> of the Macrocoſm in all things
agreeable to the <hi>Heart</hi> of the Microcoſm Man; For all things are of
one operation in Man. So alſo are we to underſtand of the reſt of the
members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for the Microcoſm the child ought always to anſwer to
the fourfold members of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm its parent; Thus we ſhall find that
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very malady and medicine is of the ſame Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy, Chyromancy and
Anotomy; He that knows not this Fundamentall cannot be a good Phiſitian. Thus
alſo we find out of ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords that Aſtrologers and Chymiologers were
very near of kin; for the Caeleſtiall Aſtronomy is as it were the Parent
and Miſtreſſe of the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, for as much as both have their own
Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, their own Sun, their own Moon, their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and their own proper
Stars; yet ſo as that the Aſtrology of ſuperiour things hath to doe with
the Chymiology of things inferiour. Thoſe Chymiſts who by the
aſſiſtance of divine Grace have attained the <hi>Mind,</hi> and rightly
know how to accommodate the properties of thoſe <pb n="28" facs="tcp:120015:26"/>bodies in

confeſſe that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth they need not travell to <hi>India</hi> or

and goodneſſe of the Creator, it is ſo ordered that the inviſible
Aſtra's of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elements ſhould be repreſented by a viſible
appearance in the ſupream Element, and that they ſhould clearly diſcover
their motions and ſeaſons, although there be nothing in the whole courſe

of the change of Externall. As Reaſon rules the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Aſtra's, ſo

                     <p>There is a twofold Heaven; Externall, as all the bodies of the

inviſible and inſenſible body of the Aſtra's is the Spirit of the
World, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls it, the Hylech, ſpread
abroad through all the Aſtra's, or rather it is all <pb n="29" facs="tcp:120015:26"/>the
Aſtra's it ſelfe; And as that Hylech in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner containes all
the Aſtra's in the great World, ſo alſo the internall Heaven of Man,
which is the Olimpick ſpirit, doth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly comprehend all the
Aſtra's. And thus the inviſible Man is not onely all the Aſtra's, but is
altogether one and the ſame thing with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world, as

Elements, we ſhall add a few things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them out of that ſhort
Treatiſe of <hi>Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> The true and purely ſpirituall Elements
are the keepers, nurſes, places, Mines, wombs and receptacles of the whole
Creation; yea the very <pb n="34" facs="tcp:120015:29"/>eſſence, exiſtence, life and
act of all Beings. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not without Things, but are filled with their
properties, which adminiſter life and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the things that are
in them, to wit, to the Seeds that they may produce out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the
things that were ſecretly treaſured up in them. Theſe (places) are
divided into two Globes, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuperiour Fire, or the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Aire, much like the ſhell and white of an egge; the inferiour, Water and
the Earth, like the yolk of an egge.</p>
                     <p>In theſe four incorporeall, empty, voyd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the

the face of the Waters, did plant the Light and Seminall cauſes of all
things, which he once filled by his heavenly Benediction, and ſhall ever be
ſupplyed by an incomprehenſible Magick out of the Eternall Treaſures of
Divine Wiſdome; knitting the Principles of bodies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wherewith they
might be covered as with a houſe or garment, and which are to laſt as long
as this worldly frame. The Seeds and Aſtra's, thoſe bonds of things, lay
hid in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Treaſures of the Elements from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the
Creation, as in a great deep, ſpringing up in their appointed times, joyning
viſible things to inviſible, the higheſt to the loweſt, by whoſe
advantage the Elements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and agree, and the whole ſympathy of
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is preſerved; by their help the World is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, indeavoring to
imitate Eternity by a continuall addition of freſh ſupply. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge 
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:120015:29"/>of the Elements cannot be attained unto without theſe
Seeds, becauſe they declare or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the uſe and ſervices of the
Elements, and as the ſeeds are to the Elements, ſo the Principles of bodies
are to them; which Principles being the inſeperable companions of the Seeds,
cleaves to them as intermingled by an indiſſoluble tye, and are furniſht
with incomprehenſible variety of gifts for the ſervice of Generations; For
the Seeds and Principles of Things receive ſtrength of Generation and
Multiplication from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of His <hi>Word,</hi> whoſe command all
things obey:<note place="margin">Hippocr. in lib. de Antiqua me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.</note> But
as the Seeds and Elements can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſeperated one from the other by the
ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt wit,<note place="margin">All things proceeds from their
powers.</note> ſo neither can the Elements and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of bodies, the
lawes of Nature ſcarce ever ſuffered them perfectly to be ſeperated by
any induſtry of Art.</p>
                     <p>Here alſo it is to be obſerved, that ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have
onely properties without Arcane or hidden ſecrets, nor have they in them that
Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionium (<hi>i. e.</hi> that wherein Nature cannot be changed but are onely
barren Relollacaeous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, (<hi>i. e.</hi> qualities whoſe force is
onely from the complexion) in which there is no vertue for curing
diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Againe, ſome bodies doe imitate the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or qualities
of Seeds, and have the Tinctures in which though heat, cold, moyſture and
dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe accord, yet no actions proceed from them, but onely for the
preſent doe aſſiſt (as it were) the companions of the deputies; in
ſuch bodies there may be a ſeperation made of the ſtrong 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120015:30"/>from the weak, of the pure from the impure. There are to us
four Elementated Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire or the Firmament, Aire, Water,
Earth, which conceive, bring forth, and againe receive or take into them all
things; they are the Fruit of the Seeds and the other Elements, which by a
conſtant and perpetuall flowing and watering doe ſerve unto generation:
from the three firſt are all compound bodies, into which they are againe
reſolved; theſe three are found in every matrix,<note place="margin">In
living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the bones reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the earth, the fleſh ayre, the vitall
ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit fire, and the humors water.</note> and in every birth of every
matrix. The Soul in man is a Caeleſtiall Fiery Element; the ſolid and
Spermatick parts are the Earth; the moyſt parts, as the Blood and other
Humors are of the Element of Water; the Aire is all that that is hollow without
ſubſtance: But theſe things, as we have ſaid, are to be underſtood of
Elementated Elements (for the true Elements are Spirituall) becauſe all the
leaſt and ſmalleſt Seeds ſtrive to imitate the oeconomy of the world,
and hold forth a dark reſemblance of the Elements and Principles; after this
ſort we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Elements are in all Things, and that they are
mingled with and preſerved by the Balſam and Radicall Tincture; Thus Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it ſelfe having the four Elements in it cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Seeds with a
fruitfull nouriſhment and multiplication. Thus much out of
<hi>Severinus;</hi> but leaſt that which he hath ſaid ſhould ſeem
obſcure to the inconſiderate Reader, we will now ſpeak more clearly of
the Elements.</p>
                     <p>He that is a true Phyloſophicall Phyſitian and would know
the four Elements or thoſe four <pb n="37" facs="tcp:120015:30"/>Pillars of the World;

The knowledge of God is Bleſſedneſſe and eternall life; for he that
knoweth God in Chriſt is made the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Temple of God, and ſo is

the viſible world we come to the knowledge of the inviſible Workman; ſo

of God. Therefore when Man the moſt perfect compleatnèſſe of all
Gods works, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat figure of the world, and expreſſe image of
God, in whom he reſted from creating, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing before him more

ſhut up and perfected in him as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream artifice in that he containeth
all things in himſelf that are in God, when (I ſay) he was on the ſixt
day made up of all things, the laſt of the Creatures, and image not onely of
the eternall God, but alſo of the great world, becauſe with it he
comprehendeth and containeth all things in himſelfe: it followeth that there
are three worlds or Heavens in Man, and that he is born about of three Worlds,
or rather is all the world, and a moſt ſure and undoubted Pattern of the
whole Univerſe.<note place="margin">

the whole frame of the world is collected and reduced into the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm,

the houſe or cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Spirits life) is from the Aſtra's of the
Firmament: Thus <hi>Adam</hi> had two bodies, that is, a viſible Elementall,
and an inviſible Sydereall body. So that now by propagation there are alwayes
two Men born, a Corporeall, Elementall, Viſible Man, the Organ and
Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inviſible, and an incorporeall Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick man which
moveth, guideth, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all skilfull matters. For the Aſtra's now in
Man doe by Man alwayes in generation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe two: The viſible
Elementary body of fleſh and blood in the mothers womb out of the four
Elements; but the inviſible Sydereall body that is capable of attaining
Phyloſophy is from the Aſtra's of the Firmament; For that little world Man
is one and the ſame in all things with his-Parant, the great world: But as
the great world is diſtinguiſhed by its ſhell or out-ſide from the
Angelicall world, ſo man the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle world is diſtinguiſhed by his skin
or out-ſide from the great world.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the Sydereall, Internall, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limpick.
Incorporeall, or <hi>(Gabalis Homo)</hi> coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated or curdled Man is the

and the knowledge of all things lie hid in the Aſtra's of the Firmament.
There is nothing ſo hidden in the world which is not praefigured in the
Aſtra's, yea all the Aſtra's of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are the Tincture of
the ſpeculation of our mind, can of their own in-bred or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall force by
imagining produce bodily and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things out of that which doth not
appear, as in a clear Heaven a great cloud ſuddenly ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from whence
come raine, mire, ſnow dew, thunder, haile, which though they were No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
before production, yet being produced out of inviſible things, they become
great bodies. Whence we may obſerve that all things in the firſt Creation
were produced out of the DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE NOTHING, or inviſible Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſticall
Poynt, into ſomething, which God did in a moment, for his works cannot be
delayed by time: All things proceeded out of the inviſible Darkneſſe, and
were called out to the viſible Light by the WORD ſpeaking, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
cheriſhing. Now whereas Man had his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereall body from the Aſtra's of the
Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the whole Imagination of Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the Aſtra's of the
Firmament, yea is the ſame and abideth one with them, it muſt needs be that
the Firmament alſo hath an Imagination but without Reaſon, as Man the
off-ſpring of the world hath with Reaſon. <pb n="71" facs="tcp:120015:47"/>One man
ſtriketh and hurteth another, and that with Reaſon, a nettle and fire burne
and hurt without Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Moreover whereas Man is the Quinteſſence of the greater
world, it follows that Man may not onely imitate Heaven, but rule it alſo at
his beck, and reigne over it at his pleaſure. All things naturally obey the
Soule, and muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity move and work toward that which the ſoule
earneſtly deſireth, and all vertues and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Naturall things obey
it when it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a vehement deſire; it makes all the powers of the
world ſerve us, when by holineſſe we draw vertue from him who is the true

obey us and the whole Hoſt of Heaven follow us.<note place="margin">By Faith we

                     <p>EVery thing that God created Good is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly perfect and
incorruptible, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but whatſoever is in theſe ſublunary
infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things hath a twofold Nature,<note place="margin">Wheat doth norgrow
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a place, nor can we have meale without bran, neither is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without
a ſting. Such Secrets are regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complexion of
qualities.</note> a perfect and an imperfect, that is, a fift Eſſence and
the dreggs may be ſeparated one from the other by fire. Seing therefore the
true medicine (or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick) is wrapt up in rindes, barks, matrixes,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, husks, garment and cottages, as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and all kernells are
covered with bark and rind (for Nature doth not bring forth the kernell of the
Cheſtnut with a ſhell and prickly husk) it is of neceſſity that the
ſame muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from the impure Elements by the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Anotomy of Chymiſts before we can come at the pure Medicine; For the bonds
are looſed by art and induſtry, and the faculties of healing ſet at
liberty.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in all orders of things that are che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the
boſome of the Elements, to wit, in thoſe three Families of Nature, the
<hi>Vegetable, Animall,</hi> and <hi>Minerall</hi> (out of which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:120015:50"/>had medicines enough to preſerve the health and cure all
bodily diſeaſes) there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that True and ſpecifix Phyſick of
materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſtempers, which as hath been ſaid, doth not conſiſt in the
four outward, naked, ſuperficiary and Relollaceous qualities (as
<hi>Theophraſtus</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly diſcourſeth) but it is a certaine
ſpecifix vertue concealed in the very Seeds, naturally proceeding without
art, which the Creator, that great Workmaſter of all things, in the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all the Creation planted in every growing thing by vertue of that
omnipotent <hi>Word,</hi> whereby all things were brought out of darkneſſe
into Light.</p>
                     <p>The faculties and vertue therefore wherewith mixt bodies are
indued (like the ſoule in mans body from the beginning of the Creation) is
not from without,<note place="margin">Heaven is the framer of the externall
edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, not of the Secrets, Wonders and myſteries that dwell in
them.</note> nor infuſed into them by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momentaneous poſition of the
Stars, nor made up of a fortuitous meeting of Atomes, it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not from
the body nor the mixture of the body or viſible forme, for then it could not
be ſeparated without the deſtruction and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body and forme,
as we ſee in Cinamon and Pepper, whoſe virtues being extracted either by
art, or vaniſhing by age and long keeping. For as all Naturall actions
proceed from Spirits and ſpirituall Tinctures, in which the mecanick
ſciences of the Three principles have their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; ſo the actions of
Cures proceed from the Spirits and vitall Tinctures of the ſpirits, not from
the bodies or dead Relloceous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:120015:51"/>
                     <p>And ſeeing it is granted by the Interpreters of Secret
Nature, that there is nothing in the whole Univerſe, every particular whereof
is not alſo in that Microcoſm Man, as hath been ſaid; yea and that the
ſeeds of all things lye hid in him, as of the Stars, Meteors, Mineralls
Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, Animalls, Spirits, even of Daemoris, in reſpect of the Spirit of
Man: upon diligent conſideration of this Symmetricall concord and Phyſicall
anagoge, it hath been the part of True Phyſitians to enquire, that if the
internall Heart of the Microcoſm or Man ſhould be ſick, how they might
borrow ſtrengthning remedies from his Parent or the externall Heart of the
Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm which is one like the other (if not in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yet in inward
figure and forme) which remedies are analogically repreſented,<note place="margin">All the whole inferiour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
parts, <hi>i. e.</hi> Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Animall, and Minerall.</note> ſuch as may
many ways be got out of thoſe three ſhops of Cures. For God created an
inexhauſtible ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of medicines, and diſtributed to every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſufficient for it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Thus among Mineralls men may find Gold (which cheareth up the
Spirits when a man hath enough of it in his purſe) Antimony and the like,
which are produced out of the Element of Water, as Gemms and precious ſtones
in ſhells are generated of drops of water, as alſo all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of
Oyſters, Muſles, and ſhell fiſh, which by a ſpecifick and Harmonicall
vertue ſerve to cure and comfort the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus alſo
among Mineralls there Magicall and Hieroglyphicall Characters, which ſage
Antiquity hath without raſhneſſe or ſuperſtition attributed to them, 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:120015:51"/>that doe ſufficiently inſinuate to Inlightned men, and
Magically diſcloſe their hidden vertue to thoſe more ſecret
Phyloſophers that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed therein. Although the choyceſt things
among them which are moſt exquifitely and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſly prepared by Nature
doe,<note place="margin">As he that hath much Gold may know nothing of its
medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall vertue.</note> by Natures juſt decree, with-hold their benigne
and vitall Element from thoſe that poſſeſſe them: And many there are
who confound the Univerſall Lawes of Nature, and yet thinks to partake of her
Banquet in the end. There is no queſtion to be made but the Gold would
diſcover moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine actions if it were rightly refined, and had its power
reduced into act by a Naturall and due Reſolution, that it might exerciſe
its vertues,<note place="margin">Art imitateth Nature and ſupplyeth its

things, becauſe Art and Nature, like mother and daughter, conſent to each
other) but few men have this gift of God beſtowed on them, ſo as to make

                     <p>Amongſt Vegetables there is Saffron, Rue, Balme, Scordium,

                     <p>Amongſt Animalls there is Hart's horn, Unicorns horn, the

which ſpectacle of Nature he would ſtir up mortall men to contemplate and
ſearch out his ſecrets, that if one man hate ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he that is hated
might cover and cure the <pb n="93" facs="tcp:120015:58"/>defect of the malicious. For which

<hi>Homer</hi> called it Contention.</p>
                     <p>Man is his own enemy; the Cauſe of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and
death in this our Kingdome divided in it ſelfe, the inteſtine duell; for in
the little world, the body, there lurketh perpetuall ſtrife, in it lyeth hid
the preſerver and deſtroyer of health; in which regard the Saints have
called the mortall body Hell and Purgatory, wherein continuall war is to be
made.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eccl.</hi> 38.15.</note> Therefore ſeeing the
Anotomy of Death findeth entertainment in the whole State of our Life, Nature
hath commanded the Phyſitians to be miniſters, and to ſeperate, not
maſters to compoſe. For our Remedies require preparations, ſeparations
and exaltations before they can impart their hidden and reſtrained
vertues.</p>
                     <p>As all things are proved by Fire, ſo alſo the Tryall of
the knowledge of Phyſick is to be made by Fire: Phyſick and Chymiſtry
cannot be ſeparated. For Chymiſtry (not that which Mountebanks uſe to
paint Faces with to make them White and Red) doth make manifeſt, not onely
the true Simples, Wonders, Secrets, Myſteries, Vertues, Forces reſpecting
health, but alſo in imatation of the Archaeon Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle or Naturall In-bred
Chymiſt, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſegregate every myſtery into into its own
reſervacle, and to free the medicines from thoſe ſcurvy raggs wherein
they were wrapt up by a due ſeparation from the impurities and corruptible
and filthy <pb n="94" facs="tcp:120015:59"/>mixture of ſuperficiall and externall
Elements, that that pure and Chriſtiline matter may be adminiſtred to our
bodies. But to deliver this from priſon and captivity, <hi>Hoc opus, hic
labor eſt,</hi> is a hard task to performe.</p>
                     <p>It is an honorable Calling when the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians live long
and are not idle in it, for without this Chymicall Phyloſophy all Phyſick
is but liveleſſe; Without Alchymicall skill there can be no Speculative or
Practick Phyſick. He that rejecteth that knowledge being diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by
the difficulty thereof ſhall never find where the diſeaſe lyeth. In this
therefore our common ſort of Phyſitians are not to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who
patronize their ſloth under other mens paines and ſtudy, and uſe to leave
the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their medicines moſt commonly to ſome careleſſe and
covetous Apothecary to the great dammage of their Patients: I ſpeake not
againſt the conſcientious Apothecaries who by their truſty diligence
ſerve the Common Wealth as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy of <hi>Vulcan.</hi> By this
artificall reſolution of bodyes the propertyes which before layd in the
compoſitions of them are now brought to light. By it alſo as by a certaine
kinde of artificiall Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſure, or figures of ſtars the Chymiſts have not
only made curtaines extending to all the borders of Nature, but alſo to the
very admiration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and perſeption of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of
every obſtruce vertue thereof, and have attained to a noble knowledge in
moſt things; and not without cauſe. Therefore a Phyſitian ſhould be
exerciſed much in this true <pb n="95" facs="tcp:120015:59"/>Analyſis and vitall Anatomy
of bodies (as hath been ſaid) becauſe there is no conſtant quality of any
body which is not to be found either in the Salt, or Mercury, or Sulphur of the

                     <p>Even the Soule or Form of every kind of thing hath not onely
more, but more excellent vertues and operations by far than either the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and willingly, for many ſometimes are ſo unwilling that they had rather dye
then drink ſuch a deale of thoſe muddy and pudly potions, which ſpoyl the
complexion of a mans body, and which the Phyſitian himſelfe that
preſcribed it, and the Apothecary that mingled, would abhor and altogether
refuſe to drink in the like caſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">Secondly, Though theſe medicines be often uſed, yet
they hurt not the ſtomack, ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindereth but that they may doe
their work and quickly both affect the body and be affected by it, for being
ſeparate in the ſtomack, they are by a naturall force carryed without
hinderance to their known lodgings, that ſo the harſh and Earthy parts of
them ſticking to the inwards, might not ulcerate, nor make them ſickly who

which cannot be denyed, this Spagyrick art is ſo neceſſary that he can be
no ſafe Phyſitian who hath it not: For many times in one ſimple thinge
there are different ſubſtances, ſomtimes of contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lityes, 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:120015:62"/>whereof one may be hurtfull, the reſt healthfull, as we

                     <p>Mineralls whoſe ſpirits exceed ours in ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and

doe much excell all Vegetables in effecting cures.</p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:120015:62"/>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſo great vertue and ſtrong o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
cannot be ſtampt upon ſuch ſoft mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is that of Plants and living
things, ſo as to retaine and hold ſuch impreſſion: Nor can it be that
Vegetables which are obnoxious to corruption ſhould ſo free Mans body from
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as the Spirits of perfect mettalls doe, which are not ſubject to
corruptions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is clear that Miniralls and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect mettalls
are indowed with great medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable vertues, as appeareth in Chyrurgical
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, there being ſcarce any Oyntment prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that is not made of an
imperfect mettall or minerall: Therefore perfect things doubtleſſe have
received of the Omnipotent far greater force and vertues.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Becauſe Nature, which deſireth to bring forth
living things and Plants fit not for any one action onely but for many vertues
and performances, could by no means ſo contemper the mixture of thoſe
bodies that they ſhould attaine to ſuch admirable power and admit of the
ſolid and ſtable Nature of a Balſom.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly. Becauſe ſtones require a long time of
generation, but perfect bodies are generated in a ſhorter ſpace: Nature
therefore by length of time can adorn precious ſtones and other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallary
bodies with a greater faculty of working, for they are not diſtracted with
the variety of ſenſible and movable offices.</p>
                     <p>Adde alſo. That precious ſtones are more to be commended
then others for their excellent temper and ſplendor, which in the

ſpoyled or corrupted by any force of Fire, and that onely becauſe of the
fixation of ſpirits that may be ſeen in it: in which reſpect it
ſtriveth to be as medicinable as Gold, and may well be preferd before the
Orientall Rubie in Phyſick, which can ſcarce indure the Fire as many hours

                        <note place="margin">Gemmes are Elementary Stars.</note>This
alſo by the way is to be obſerved, that precious ſtones have the Colour,

out the Hermetick Phyloſophy and the marvellous works of God, they that
chaſe the ſecrets of hidden cauſes all throughout Nature, and would know
all that is to be known (for it is not unlawfull to pry into thoſe things
which exceed even naturall order) theſe are not ſo much aſtonyed at the
ſports of Nature, becauſe from the intimacy of more hid and ſecret
Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy they know that that ſame Spirit and minerall Nature which
produceth Gold in the bowells of the Earth is alſo in Man. That Spirit in
Gold is the ſame with the generating ſpirit of all Creatures, and is the
ſame and onely genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nature diffuſed through all things: This Spirit
now hath aſſumed a Naturall body; It is that which firſt moveth and

                     <p>
                        <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> writeth, that in his time there hath
been Gold found in the bodyes and heads of ſome that were hanged; in his Book
of Mineralls he ſaith that Gold may be found every where: There is not,
ſaith he, that thing Elementated of the four Elements in which 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:120015:65"/>Gold Naturally may not be found in the laſt
ſubtiliation thereof. And therefore the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſay that the matter

                     <p>
                        <hi>Riplaeus à Portis</hi> agreeth with them both:
Remember that Man is the moſt noble Creature of all, in whom there is the
Naturall Mercuriality of the four Elements, which Nature hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned,
which is of little worth, and may be got out of its Mine by art.</p>
                     <p>Adde <hi>Rhaſis</hi> to <hi>Riplaeus,</hi> as one that doth
not altogether diſſent from him: In his Book of Divinity, You may eaſily,
ſaith he, perceive <pb n="107" facs="tcp:120015:65"/>that the things of Nature are ſo
coucht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a ſubtle artifice, that in every thing there is every
thing potentially, though it doth not actually appear.</p>
                     <p>But I forbear to cite more Authors, though I might produce a
great heap of Phyloſophers, who confirme theſe things, not by common and
outſide arguments, but by ſolyd reaſons drawn from the inſide of
things, ſuch as would be weighty witneſſes and beyond the exceptions of
any Sophiſters. But theſe things are by the by.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The Chymicall way of Subtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Extracting, and
Separating being imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, was not much uſed in <hi>Galens</hi> dayes (for
they knew not how to ſeparate the bark and husk from the kernell) it was
altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, which yet being ignorant of it, he very much
deſired, as may be gathered from his own words, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. Whey, Butter and Cheeſe are

he tryed all wayes and means to diſtinguiſh the facultyes of ſimple
medicines, and diſcern the hot parts of vineger from the cold, if
poſſible he might find out any deviſe to ſeparate the contrary parts of
vineger as well as of milk; who in this thing might have obtained his deſire
if he had been well skild in the Diſtillatory Art. Nor is it any diſgrace
to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> or <hi>Galen</hi> that they knew not theſe things:
For God and Nature (which is the order and ſeries of Gods works, and obey the
power, word and command of God, and borroweth all its vertue and efficacy from
him) who doe nothing in vaine, they doe not beſtow <pb n="108" facs="tcp:120015:66"/>upon
mankind all things together and at once, but doe communicate particular gifts
to ſeverall ages, nor doe they inriſh one man with all, but diſtribute to
every one his particular gift. Hence it appeareth how contrary the judgement of
many now is to the judgement of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who if they knew not any thing
which they heard was known to others, though in very far countryes, they would
run all hazards of ſea and land to find it out. Doubtleſſe if
<hi>Galen</hi> had lived when <hi>Paracelſus</hi> did, he would not have
envyed, but reverenced his learning, nor would he have been aſhamed of his
Coals; but as he was deſirous of learning, ſo would he gladly have ſerved
<hi>Theophraeſtus</hi> for nothing many years, if it had been for nothing
elſe but to know how to ſeparate the three firſt (qualities) in vineger,
but eſpecially to learn the preparations of thoſe high Magiſteryes and
Elixirs, neither would he have refufed to blow the coals or temper his
ſtuffe, or watch his work; he would have undergone any condition ſo that he
might have gained this worthy ſcience: nothing regarding the rage of
Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and Melancolick Phileraſtian Phyſitians, who have not learned
ſo much as their A. B. C. in the Spagyrick Phyſick, nor know any thing of
the Creation and compoſition of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Aſtrall Man, much leſſe
of the Mechanick Spirits of diſeaſes; Yet they bluſh not raſhly, and
proudly, without any conſcience of ſhame, purpoſely paſſing by meaner

abſolute knowledge of all Divine and Humane ſciences, beyond what will be

rambling ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, one that was no Phyloſopher at all, and malitiouſly,
though with loſt labour, to load him whom they underſtand not, to their own

which will not turne to Mans hurt or ruine if it be abuſed? ſo that the

                     <p>The onely and alone NATURES of Phyſicall medicines, as hath
been ſaid, or thoſe Hippocraticall vertues are they which doe the cures,
the Phyſitian is but the miniſter or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. And this very ſelfe
ſame Nature, which is our Life and Balſom, or balſomicall Mummy, that
preſerveth the body from all corruption, by means of the Saline moyſture,
that is, of the inferiour Balſom ſpringing up in the inferiour from the
ſuperiour, I ſay, this very Nature of ours (which ſometimes worketh
wonders, when the Phyſitians to their great diſgrace and ſhame of their
Profeſſion could doe no good, but have left their Patient to their
Progniſticks) is its own proper Phyſitian in Mans body, who asketh nothing
of the outward Phyſitian but Inſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or as tis commonly called,
fortification applyed to the diſeaſed part by a moſt pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine when
the like Nature is not at hand: And thus the Medicinall Balſom like a
coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour or privy counſellour aſſiſteth the Vitall or Radicall and
Naturall Balſom becauſe of the ſimpathy and common agreement between 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:120015:70"/>them. Thus it recovereth the Naturall decayed
ſtrength,<note place="margin">Nature cureth with like things.</note> which
being reſtored it is of it ſelfe able as an inward and unknown Antidote to
chaſe all its enemies out of its Monarchy by the onely power of the Vitall
facultyes.</p>
                     <p>To go about to cure a diſeaſe with contrary qualities, is
to raiſe and ſtir up intrinſick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions to the utter overthrow of
Nature, which is to much weakned and waſted already by inteſtine
quarrells.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Contraryes will not willingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine each
other: And if they cloſe not one with the other, nor work one upon another,
nor ſuffer any thing from each other, then where there is no true action and
paſſion, there can follow no true Naturall effect.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore medicines ſhould not be contrary to the grieved
part, but very agreeable to it, and have the ſame Externall Nature (becauſe
of the Harmony between the great and little world) as the place affected hath
the Inward, that the Internall Nature which ſtands in need of it may both be
ſtrengthned and ſuccoured by the ſuperabundance of that Externall Nature:
Man is therefore called a Microcoſm or little world, becauſe the whole
world preſerveth, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and cureth him. When the fruits of the Earth,
Aire, Water and Fire of the Microcoſm are ſick, they muſt be reſtored
by fruits like themſelves of the Macrocoſm. Thus Nature doth ſtrengthen
and help its own Nature: For Nature ſtrengthened and aſſiſted by its
own Nature doth more forcibly drive out all its <pb n="117" facs="tcp:120015:70"/>enemyes,
ſeeing every Nature is Naturally the beſt preſerver of it ſelfe. Thus
Nature is not onely our companion, but our friend and ready helper, it alone
being the genuine Phyſitian of all diſeaſes, as <hi>Galen</hi>
witneſſeth in his 13 Book of Method. It is the Firſt Mover of every cure,
without whoſe ſtrength and vigour all Phyſick is in vaine and to no
purpoſe, Nature continued in its Temperature is in it ſelfe medicinable,
and it ſelfe healeth its own infirmities by the innate Mummy; when that

naturall inſtinct deſireth to be perfected and preſerved: On the
contrary, it doth moſt vehemently abhorre the deſtruction of it ſelfe,
and deſireth as much as may be to be kept from it: dayly experience makes it
plaine, as when any part of our body is wounded with a ſword or other
wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: for thoſe that are wounded perceive a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous ſuccour

con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traryes are to be cured by Contraryes, they are not much miſtaken if they
have not reſpect to the qulaityes, but the vertues of a contrary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; For

conſiſteth in the preſervation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the continuall malice of

which is moſt cold, it is not by the coldneſſe of Opium, but but by the
Specifick venemous vertue of the Opium which hath a greater degree of poyſon
then the occult venomous power of that Peſtilence. <pb n="119" facs="tcp:120015:71"/>Thus
Nature deſtroyeth one poyſon by another, it ſubdueth a weak evill by a
ſtronger; and fighteth againſt her enemy both with healthfull and hurtfull
weapons, that ſo ſhee may keep her own things in ſafety, and beat her
enemy out of her poſeſſion by any meanes whatſoever: As winter doth not
deſtroy ſummer, nor ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer winter, but one gives place to the other,
ſo one quality doth not deſtroy another; for without vertue the quallity is
dead and wholly accidentall, and conſequently cannot afford any life or
ſubſtance which the medicine muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity do if it would
ſuccor Nature indeed. And here alſo it is worth the noting, that Roots of
diſeaſes in the body of Man are neither hot nor cold, but whereas nothing
can be without heate therefore the diſeaſe alſo is ſaid to be either
hot or cold though thoſe Accidents and Excrements are but the ſignes of the
diſeaſe, and not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe it ſelfe. For the moſt pernitious
diſeaſes and Traytors of the body do not ſpring out of the matter of the
body, or out of the four Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but from the Nature of the Seed or Aſtra's
and Inviſible mechanick Spirits of the Three principles, which Spirits alſo
build their outward houſe and habitation with ſhells. Theſe Forgers and
Inviſible Aſtra's of diſeaſes were not knowne to the Ancients.
Phyſick is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (not a body) which the Magician or wiſe man only can

well known, within which are all thing, without which is nothing, and no
perfect knowledge of any thing. The Light of Grace, begetteth a true Theologer,
yet not without Phyloſophy: The Light of Nature, which is the Treaſury of
God confirmed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, maketh a true Phyloſopher, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Theoligie, which is the Foundation of true Wiſdome. The works of God are
bipactite; Philoſophy comprehendeth the works or way of Nature; Theologie
onely knoweth the works and way of Chriſt: In theſe two wayes we are to

Here for brevity ſake I willingly paſſe by the Herbariſts, who commonly

ſpend ſome time in reading the works of this new Phyloſopher and
Phyſitian, not ſuperficially and prefunctorily, but with greateſt
diligence and attention of mind. For in this kind of ſtudy we are to imitate
the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and induſtry of the Bees, who ſuck and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their hony

hath recanted ſomething of his over haſty writings) as if they were all
Goſpel-Oracles, as we ſee many who even worſhip the concluſions, and

                     <p>The intelligent Readers will take notice that
<hi>Paracelſus</hi> hath joyned the exercetation of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther medicine
together, as well that of Phyſick as of Chyrurgie, in imitation and after the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Great <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> For he aſſigned or ſet down a
twofold Medicine, Phyſicall or the knowledge of all diſeaſes, and
Chyrurgicall or the curing of the ſame, which like the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters work
cannot be done without hands: Nor can either without the other ſafely
conſiſt or be exerciſed but with great hurt and danger of the ſick;
Therefore it is neceſſary that every Surgeon ſhould be a Phyſician, and
every Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian a Chyrurgion, that there may be a ſound Bridgroom for a
ſound Bride: The choice alſo of the Medicines muſt alway be conſidered,
and their preparations and compoſitions made by the Phyſitian himſelfe,
and not careleſly left to others. He is truly a genuine Phyſitian, who can
tell how (not onely by Reaſon, as mear <pb n="152" facs="tcp:120015:88"/>Rationall
Phyſitians doe, but) by their own hand to prepare the medicaments which they
know, to ſeperate and purge them from their poyſon and dreggs, to reduce
them to their pure ſimplicity, and not leave them to an unskilfull cook: For
the Bad and Good are mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither is Sugar free from faeculent
impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor is honey voyd of a venemous bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: when they are
prepar'd he muſt with true faith and acurate skill or judgement accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
them to mans neceſſities, that the root of the diſeaſe may be plucked
up; by this means his honeſt and quick diſpatch will prevent the patients
complaints.</p>
                     <p>A Phyſitian therefore ſhould have both the Theory and
Practice, he muſt both know and prepare his medicines, for judgement without
practice is altogether barren and fruitleſſe. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is learned by the
labour of the hands and practicall working or making it up, when the Fire
diſcovereth new and moſt pleaſant Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies continually, which Nature
dayly more and more purgeth from their ſuperfluities, and then delivereth
them to her Servant to make them up: But the <hi>great Doctors</hi> of our
time, who are grown gray in the vulgar art of Phyſick, will not become
ſchollers and ſchool-boyes againe, <hi>to dig they are aſhamed:</hi> And
as tis hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move an old tree, or to bring an old dog to the collar and
make him a good hunter, ſo theſe men will openly contradict the truth, and
with a canine obſtinate bawling bark at it, and bite it rather then endeavour
to reform their errours, <pb n="153" facs="tcp:120015:88"/>leaſt they ſhould not ſeem
to be wiſe enough, or be thought to learn ſomething better from others: But
though they exclaime and cry out againſt the Chymiſts as if they were no
Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, though they be the moſt skilfull of any, but that they are the
onely Phyſitians who in judgement and Reaſon (undervaluing Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry)
know how to apply any Remedy to every diſeaſe, yet theſe Rationall
Phyſitians when they come to the ſick mans bed know not what to doe or
which way to turne themſelves, but ſtand wondering and as men amazed,
ſpeaking ſmoothly, and giving their patient a parcell of good words onely,
being able to doe nothing toward his recovery, becauſe they can prepare their
medicines but onely with their Reaſon, not at all with their hand.</p>

Life approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which cannot be prolong'd by any art or help of Man. No
Medicine can preſerve the corruptible body from death, the wages and
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin; but there is one thing that hindereth corruption,
reneweth youth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the ſhort life, as in the Patriarchs: But
although, as we ſhall ſhew anon, the life may be ſhortned or lengthned,
yet by the immutable decree of the Eternall Law, we muſt of neceſſity die
at laſt in reſpect of the puniſhment of ſin, leaſt with
<hi>Plato</hi> we conclude a receſſe after ſuch <pb n="159" facs="tcp:120015:91"/>a

And in this caſe the univerſall and chiefeſt medicine is of no effect,
becauſe no induſtry or skill of Artiſt or Nature can perpetuate the
wedlock of life and death, which by an immutable neceſſity is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe through the ignorance of
unskilfull Phyſitians, and their naughty medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, the ſick is brought to
that paſſe, that the diſeaſe is corrupt, pernicious, and incurable,
ſo that he cannot be repaired or recovered by good medicines: And to ſuch
commonly the Chymiſts are ſent for,<note place="margin">

<hi>Trophilus,</hi> who ſaid that he was a compleat Phyſitian who could
judg what might be done, and what not; ſuch never make uſe of their noble
and undeſerved Remedies, with a vaunting oſtentation to their diſgrace,
when the ſick is paſt all hope of mans help, for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a wiſe man
to prevent (an errour) rather than repent of it: Let them take heed alſo they
mix not their own medicines with others poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, leaſt the miſcarriage be
aſcribed to the good and the recovery to the bad, for it is a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing to ſee the curſed hatred of ſome Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, who rather than
they will allow another his due honour, who is more able than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to
maintaine their tottering credit, will utterly caſt away the Patient, who
might be <pb n="160" facs="tcp:120015:92"/>recovered by anothers skill, ſuch as theſe
men commonly (and juſtly) call Honeſt Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the Phyſitian is ſent for too
late, when Nature is overcome and the diſeaſe hath got the maſtery:
Otherwiſe if the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian had Seaſonably caſt fit leed of Phyſick
into the ſick mans body, reſiſting the diſeaſe at firſt, no doubt
but by Gods bleſſing the expected fruit of health would have ſprung
up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe the ſick doth not follow
directions: For ſo it is many times, that the ſick layes the fault on the
Phyſick or Phyſitian when he himſelfe committed it by his diſorderly
living contrary to the Golden law of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crians</hi> recorded by
<hi>Aelianus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Becauſe ſome mens Natures or peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
qualityes are not ſo eaſy to be cured; As we ſee ſome extraordinary
hard knotty wood ſo much degenerate from its naturall ſoftneſſe that it
can hardly be cloven and very often the Time or Seaſon, together with the bad
inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aſtra's is very croſſe and contrary to the
health:<note place="margin">In cures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is to be had to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for in ſummer one courſe is to be taken, in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, in Autumn
another.</note> For whatſoever is cured before the time is ſubject to a
relaps tis a very inſtant of the Seaſon or time of the harveſt only that
makes a ſure and certaine cure: A ripe pear or apple will fall of its own
accord, but before wee ſhake the tree in vaine to get it down. If thoſe
things be not conſidered, eſpecially in the cure of Aſtrall diſeaſes,
all things are of no moment, and we goe about the work to no perpoſe
Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians alſo ſhould make it their care that they <pb n="171" facs="tcp:120015:92"/>and their Phyſick do not more hurt than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe it ſelfe,
therefore let them never adviſe with that which tendeth to the deſtruction
of ſoul and body, but make it their chiefe care that they doe no hurt when
they can doe no good. So ſhall they keep a good conſcience, which is the
conſtant joy of the heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Becauſe diſeaſes are come to their
appoynted period, and then by the Lawes of Nature there can be no recovery, as
in perfect, abſolute and compleat bituminous, Colar, ſtony and ſandy
coagulations: For of ſuch like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated diſeaſes their is no cure,
as wee ſo in thoſe that are born blind and deafe. For what Nature hath once
taken away the Phyſitian can by no means reſtore,<note place="margin">None
can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> if the ſubſtance of the body be
miſhapen, and the parts thereof miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed from the conception, there is no

                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> As the baſe nigardlyneſſe of
the ſick (though there is no money more honeſtly got, and more unwillingly
parted with) make the Phyſitian negligent in his office; So alſo many times
the ſick parties doubt, diſtruſt, and unbeliefe of the Phyſitians
diligence and care, doth either retard the effect of the Phyſick, or
altogether hinder the endeavor of the Phyſitian, to ſay nothing of thoſe
who diſpiſe the Order of <hi>God,</hi> and will take no Phyſick in the
greateſt extremity, but think to be made well by God (though indeed he be the
onely <hi>Phyſitian</hi>) without the uſe of <hi>Means</hi> by which he

                     <p>A Phyloſopher muſt covet Nothing but Wiſdome, which is
converſant about Divine things; therefore a true Phyloſopher never ſought
after nor deſired riches, but is rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the Myſteries of
Nature, for verily he that is adept or hath attained the ſame may carry about
with him in his purſe, not the worth of one Kingdom only, but the wealth
almoſt of the whole World, and in God &amp; with God po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe as a Lord
all things of the whole World, and in the Fear and ſervice of God command the

                     <p>This is that Secret laid up and buryed in the moſt ſecret

the ſecret of their heart, made it known to any but ſuch who had an
underſtanding allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. For doubtleſſe that liberty is granted to
the Phyloſophers, that becauſe they are made Lords of Things, they ſhould
alſo have power to diſpence or give Names at their pleaſure,<note place="margin">This is not believed, but being proved with the gain of labor,
toyl and hazard, it is made plain toward the end which proveth the work. On

ignorant of the Myſteries of the Element of Water, dream that the Deluge
waſhed away the efficacy of fruits &amp; of growing things, or that the power

we want nothing but the knowledge of Secrets, and their uſe. And thus the
Flood did not waſt the things that grow, but waſh'd away our wiſdome of
knowing them. Theſe moſt ſecret of ſecrets have ever been hid from the
common ſort of them that profeſſe Phyloſophy, and eſpecially
ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men began to abuſe Wiſdome, uſing it to an ill end, which God
beſtow'd upon them for their health and advantage.</p>
                     <p>But as few reach the Naturall Terme, ſo alſo few have
known the reaſon of prolonging the <pb n="219" facs="tcp:120015:116"/>life: And hereof
there are many Cauſes. For the life is broken off, or ſhortned, two manner
of wayes.</p>

e.</hi> that the act of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and that one mans body
cannot be altered by another mans imagination.</note> And theſe diſeaſes
which only Adept Phyſitians know, are healed without the help of Natural
Phyſick. For in the minds of men there is a kind of a hidden Virtue, of
chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, attracting, and binding that which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth either to attract,
or change, or bind, or hinder, eſpecially if it be ſet againſt it with

This is no ſtrange thing to them that know the operations, thoſe wonderfull

deſtroyed by them, their malignant Aſtra's muſt be averted by a

neceſſity which is content and ſatisfied with a little, have ſurfeted

faſtings, and a moderate Diet is the beſt Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to prolong the life.
And this cure of the harmes of the Naturall members which come from the Ens or
Being, is to be ſought from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes and means, to wit, from the
Elements and hidden Secrets: For all diſeaſes require their own proper
cure, and reject any other remedy: Corporall medicines doe no good to mentall
or ſupernaturall diſtempers, nor can mentall medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines be profitable to
bodily diſeaſes. This alſo is to be conſidered, that many times weare
corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our mothers womb, ſometimes in the birth and education, and by
many various accidents may we be hindred and kept from attaining to the
Naturall Term of life, as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his Books very often
obſerveth.</p>

the publick good to make known alſo in publick writing what belongs to the

good, that poſterity may be inſtructed, and the great bounty of God
ſpread abroad and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; both becauſe at this time I ſee it taught

with neceſſary expences, who was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unable to bear and undergoe
ſo great a burden as all theſe Medicins come to, which muſt be prepar'd

his expences, but will alſo for ever to all poſterity be thanked by
forraign Nations. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in reſpect of what concerns the order and

to add hereunto the further Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his own, and diſpoſe it

inlarg'd it; And ſo I doubt not but that this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of Chymicall Corn,
and the Firſt fruits of my increaſe, and this Spagyrick preſent of my
difficult and laborious diligence (than which I ſuppoſe I could not leave
behind me a better to my Country and Common-wealth) will be moſt acceptable

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:120015:119"/>doubt of Many things: It is provided for by the

their wits are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made fit for the School of Phyloſophers. He that
can receive it let him receive it; and he that doth not underſtand, let him
either learn or hold his peace and be ſilent: Nevertheleſſe the young
Pupil that is a diligent Searcher out of the Ancient Firſt &amp; Sacred

ſignification of MANY things by a Few in this open market of Nature, not by a

that can endure the Truth lay aſide rancor, and read thoſe things with a

with a diligent and conſiderate judgement of the MIND not depraved by his
affections, ſhall at laſt with great thankfulnes acknowledge that the doors
and Inner rooms are unlockt to him by the favorable virtue of the moſt high
Creator, and from all theſe things rightly underſtood, through PRAYER &amp;
PAINS, ſhall reap much more fruit than he expected. If hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily there be any

let them not vex and trouble without cauſe the laborious diligence of

not to be refer'd as well to the hotneſſe as the coldneſſe. Nor doth

yet have they freedome to converſe with things on the Earth, and to generate
with them. The like compaction alſo is there from the aire, which may be
ſeen and felt; yet as a procreation of the firſt ſeparation, but onely as
a conſequence. For as a beetle is bred of dung, ſo may a monſter of the
airy Element aſſume a bodily ſhape with airy words, thoughts and deeds,

depend on man: Who <pb n="24" facs="tcp:120015:133"/>thereby is made more a companion of

it muſt not be repay'd by that which is mortall. And though bodies may

eternall. Therefore that onely is judged that is eternall in us. And though one
exact upon or judge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet all mortall things, which have the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
in them, muſt die whether they will or no, ſo that the eternall onely
ſhall ſtay behind here, without company of the body. Thus the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is
finiſhed. For that onely is eternall, nor is there any more of it to come in
the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of every mortall thing. Now if thoſe things, that
had the eternall in them, have ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:120015:133"/>nothing
now remaineth but what was eternall of it ſelfe, and did nouriſh and
increaſe that which was mortall. That which is good for nothing doth not
tarry in the creature. All other things are only for the ſake of that which
is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Hence alſo it is that which hath the erer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in it ſelfe,
and with it all things that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it, may die and periſh together. That
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaineth that is eternall. Whence the end of all bodily things is
evident, even nothing, to which they all revolt. For they are ſeparated from
their owneſſence into nothing that is, from ſomething, into nothing. But
man deſireth a perfect ſeparation, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the eternall from the
mortall. Now is the judgement, when the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all things under
heaven is proclaimed. If there were no reaſon why a thing ſhould be
fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill, the creature ſhould never die, no death ſhould be in it, but all
things would be eternall. The onely reaſon whereof is this, becauſe we
mortalls live not in righteouſneſſe, we judge not right judgement among
our ſelves one toward another, nor have we received the power of the eternall
to judge. Theſe things belong to the eternall. Which ſeeing it ought to be
ſo, all we muſt of neceſſity be brought and come together. Thus have we
found the diſſolution of all things.</p>

the Element of water <pb n="30" facs="tcp:120015:136"/>is moyſt, the element of aire dry.
Where we muſt as well conſider, that every of the ſaid natures is
peculiarly ſuch a one by it ſelfe apart. For fire is onely hot, and not
dry, nor moyſt. The earth is onely cold, not dry, nor moyſt. The water is
onely moyſt, not hot, nor cold. The aire is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dry, not hot, nor cold.
And therefore are they called Elements;<note place="margin">The nature of the

But their manifeſtation through all the creatures muſt be underſtood as

yet far otherwiſe then the Ancients imagined.<note place="margin">The Colick
whence it is.</note> For the Colick is of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire, yet not
compounded of horneſſe and dryneſſe, but is onely hot. And ſo the
other complexions. Therefore if we find any diſeaſe mixt with heat and
drought, we may ſuppoſe that two Elements are there, one in the liver,
another in the ſpleen, and ſo in the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. There are not two
Elements in one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For certaine it is, that every member hath a peculiar
element, which we leave to Phyſitians <pb n="31" facs="tcp:120015:136"/>to define. But
this cannot well be affirmed, that two elements ſhould conſiſt both
together, or that one and the ſame element ſhould be both hot and moyſt.
Nor can there be any ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. There are no compounded Elements, for
the reaſon before given. Where there is heat, there is neither cold, nor
drought, nor moyſture. So where there is coldneſſe, there is none of all
the reſt. The ſame may be ſaid of moyſture and dryneſſe. Every

which Philoſophers talk of, concerning a conjuction of the Elements, is as
much as comes to nothing. For no Element of water hath any heat in it. Nor can
there be any heat in moyſture. Every Element is alone by it ſelf. So alſo
cold cannot of it ſelf indure dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: It ſubſiſteth pure by it
ſelf. And thus much be ſpoken to be underſtood of the proper eſſence
of the Elements. All dryneſſe is a diſſolution of cold. As moyſture
and dryneſs cannot be mixt; ſo much leſſe can coldneſſe and
dryneſs or moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, or heat and dryneſſe cloſe or conſiſt

muſt know that an Element is nothing but a ſoul. Not as though it were of

The difference between the ſoul of an Element and the eternall ſoul is
this.<note place="margin">A compariſon between fire and the ſoul.</note> The
ſoul of the Elements is the life of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The fire that burneth is
not the Element of fire, as we ſee,<note place="margin">What fire is.</note>
but its ſoul which we cannot ſee is the Element and life of fire. Now the
ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire may be no leſſe in a green ſtick than it is in the fire:
But the very life is not alike there as it is in fire. This then is the
difference between the ſoul and the life. If fire live, it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: But if
it be in the ſoul, that is, in its Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then it cannot burn. Nor doth it
follow, that a cold thing muſt needs proceed from a cold Element; for oft
times it is from a hot one. And many cold things come from the Element of fire.
Whatſoever doth grow,<note place="margin">What are the properties of all the

is fixt, is from the Element of earth. That which nouriſheth, is from the

grow is the property onely of fire. When that faileth or goeth out, there is no

the Element of ſire. So were it not for the Element of aire, there could be
no nouriſhment. For all things are nouriſhed by the aire onely. Alſo
nothing could be diſſolved or conſumed, were it not for the Element of

The monſter of the ſea may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as the errour of the
Firmament. So that a peculiar world, with its myſterie, to the end of the
world, may be found out in the water. They have the ſame principle with the
other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Their end is no other, but as the reſt of the Elements is.
The onely difference is of the forms, eſſence, and natures, that happen to
them, with their ſignatures and Elements.<note place="margin">How there are
four worlds.</note> Hence we may find four worlds, according to the four
Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and primary habitations; but there is but one Eternall, in

Sun or Planets did receive their luſtre or motion from the Element of fire,

onely the living creatures of its own world. And ſo of the aire: There are

their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar motion there, as in their own world. The ſame may be ſaid
of fire.<note place="margin">The Nymphs gender with earthy things.</note> Now if

the evill that ſhall befall a people is preſag'd to them. And thoſe
